What is this script?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
cmake_project_bootstrap.sh: one-step compile and install software
locally.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input: one argument, path to a software source code tree that contains
a \`CMakeLists.txt\`.

Output:

* a separate compilation directory
* setup to install locally in a sibling directory.
* both are suffixed with the local operating system variant

Why?

* Time saver: this allows one-step building of software once you have
  the source code.

These benefits come from upstream tools, this scripts only provides
them easily:

* No privilege: installing on a local directory means no need to be
  root or whatever.

* Easy cleanup: installing on a local directory means easy to clean
  up.

* Easy save space: after install you can remove build tree (perhaps
  even source tree) easily.

* Suffixing with operating system name and version means that there's
  never any doubt about which operating system a particular directory
  is targetting.  Thus, no surprise about missing library at run time,
  no crash due to subtle library breakage.  If you change OS, just
  re-run the script on your new OS and bam it works!

[BAM! I got it running.](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-02-17)

## One-way reference
#
# Wise man says: a built tree should refer to its source tree to
# enable updated builds, but a source tree must not know any build
# tree.  CMake and GNU configure do that naturally.
#
# Why?  Because one source tree can result in a variety of compiled
# binaries due to a variety of build settings, dependencies, compilers
# and operating systems.
#
# The fool builds binaries inside the source tree.  Variety comes and
# puts the fool into trouble.  Crying for simplicity, the fool gives
# up on keeping several binary artifacts from the same source and,
# even then, suffer on operating system upgrades.
#
# Thus, wisdom commands not to change anything in the source tree when
# building software.  If you don't change anything, the source tree
# cannot know if it's been compiled at all.  CMake and GNU configure
# do that naturally.
#
# As a bonus, it makes easy to delete big build tree (or even source
# tree) if only install tree is to be kept.
#
#
## Build and install tree close to source
#
# Wise man also says that test-drive-and-forget installations should
# have build tree and install trees close to the source tree.
#
# Why? It's the simplest thing to do in one automated step and make
# highly probable that build tree can find again source tree when an
# update is needed.
#
#
## Mark build and install tree with OS version
#
# Finally, wise man says that build and source tree should show what
# environment they target.  On operating system variation, is makes
# easy to know if any binary is compatible, and destroy any that is no
# longer useful.
#
# Wise man knowing its tools can reclaim space on OS upgrade with:
#
# find /mystorage -iname "*.OSID_myoldOS.*tree" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf
